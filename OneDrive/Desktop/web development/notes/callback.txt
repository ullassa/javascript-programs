### What is a **Callback** in JavaScript?

A **callback** is simply a **function** that you **give** to another function, and that function gets called **later**. This is commonly used when you need to run some code after a certain task is done.

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Simple Example:**

Imagine you have a function that greets someone, and then you want to say goodbye after that. Instead of saying goodbye immediately, we give the "say goodbye" action to the greet function and tell it to run later.

```javascript
function greet(name, callback) {
    console.log("Hello " + name);
    callback();  // The callback function will be called here
}

function sayGoodbye() {
    console.log("Goodbye!");
}

// Calling greet function and passing the sayGoodbye function as a callback
greet("Ullas", sayGoodbye);
```

**Output:**
```
Hello Ullas
Goodbye!
```

### Key Points:
- **greet** is the main function.
- **sayGoodbye** is a **callback** because it‚Äôs passed into the greet function and is called later (after "Hello").
- The **callback** is executed after the greet function finishes running.

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Why do we use Callbacks?**

Sometimes, you need to wait for something to finish before doing another thing. For example, imagine waiting for data from a server or a delay (like waiting for 2 seconds). You don‚Äôt want to just stop the program while waiting.

Callbacks help you **keep your code running** while waiting for that task to finish. Here‚Äôs an example:

### Example with **setTimeout** (waiting for 2 seconds):

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("This message appears after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);  // Waits for 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds)

console.log("End");
```

**Output:**
```
Start
End
This message appears after 2 seconds
```

**Explanation:**
- The `setTimeout` function runs after 2 seconds, but it **doesn‚Äôt stop** the other code from running. That‚Äôs why "End" is printed before the second message.
- The function inside `setTimeout` is the **callback** that gets run after 2 seconds.

### Why Callbacks are Useful?

Callbacks are useful when you want to **run code later**, without stopping everything else. For example:
- Waiting for data to come from the internet.
- Running a task after a certain delay.
- Reading a file (it takes time, so you want to run code after it's done).
